# Toystory-game

This is a game made in python based off of the non existent Toy Story 5. You can either be Buzz or Woody. Woody has to find Buzz if you choose Woody or if you choose Buzz you have to find Woody. You run into a series of characters along the way. This uses a series of datatypes, inputs and if statements to create a story based on user actions.
